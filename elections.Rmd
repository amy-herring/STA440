# Learning Objectives

- continue developing skills in using models for prediction
- evaluate and update predictions based on dynamic data
- combine data on a variety of levels (national, state, individual) to predict election outcomes

# Case Study Goals
Goals of this case study are (1) to predict the outcome of the presidential election, (2) to predict whether the US Senate remains in Republican control, (3) to predict the electoral college vote, (4) to predict the outcomes of all NC Congressional elections (the 13 federal Representatives to Congress), and (5) to predict the outcome of the NC Senate election, including characterization of uncertainty in predictions.

We will present predictions and corresponding uncertainty quantification weekly. In addition, prizes will be given in a number of categories (e.g., most creative useful data source).

# Reports

- Groups: you can select your own group, or I can put you into groups. There are no restrictions on who can be in your group. It must have at least 3 members and no more than 5. Groups will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.  I reserve the right to add group members to smaller groups if needed (any groups I construct from students without team member preferences will aim to have 4-5 students).

- Interim report: who votes in NC? Using the NC voter files, identify who votes in NC so that these data can be used in conjunction with surveys and other data in order to predict outcomes of NC congressional elections. Present results in short (<5 min) video presentation on October 16. This report will be peer reviewed.
- Weekly updates on predictions starting 9/16
- Final report: Items for Final Report
  - The final report itself should be structured with an introduction, description of methods (e.g., modeling and prediction strategy along with the models themselves), results (point and interval estimates of the % of votes won by each Congressional candidate; point and interval estimates of relevant probabilities, etc). Discussion should include some evaluation of the relative predictive ability of variables in your models (e.g., maybe you tried to predict voter turnout as a function of pet ownership rates, but maybe pet ownership rates are not at all predictive â€“ so we want to know which data sources you felt were most useful) as well as discussion of strengths and weaknesses of your strategy. Any visualizations should be included (or linked, if they are interactive) in the final report. The final report should contain two appendices, described below.
    - Appendix A: Numbered list of all models/modeling procedures, with explicit details about model purpose, model structure, and resulting estimates from each model (raw output is fine for this appendix). Reproducible code and data should also be uploaded to Sakai.
    - Appendix B: List of all data sets/data sources used, along with an explicit mapping from the models in Appendix A to the variables used from Appendix B in each model.
- Video presentation after election: discuss what went right and wrong with your modeling and assumptions based on election outcomes (e.g., winners, who voted, etc.)

# Assessment

In addition to the usual grade, a best prediction winner will be chosen, with all due honor and glory, based on the following algorithm developed by students in STA 340 (decision analysis), shown here for the outcome of the 13 NC congressional races. We'll include the NC senate race in this algorithm as well.

For a predicted vote share $p$, truth $\theta$, and confidence interval $CI$ with bounds $p_\min, p_\max$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
L(p, \theta) &=
100\cdot|p-\theta| + I\{\theta\notin CI\}\cdot200\min\{|p-p_\min|,|p-p_\max|\} + 10\cdot|p_\max-p_\min|\\& + I\{0.5\notin CI\}\cdot\big(10\cdot I\{wrong\} - 3\cdot I\{right\}\big)  \\
S &= -\sum_{i=1}^{13} L(p_i, \theta_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

Point estimates within the $CI$ are penalized linearly and outside the $CI$ are penalized linearly with a higher slope. There is an additional penalty for wide confidence intervals, but only at 1/10th (or less) the cost of missing the point estimate. 

The term on the second line of the loss function only comes into play when a confidence interval did not include 0.5. That is, the team was very certain of calling the race for one side or the other. Being very certain and wrong incurs an additional loss. Being very certain and right incurs utility, but with lower magnitude than being wrong. The idea behind this choice is some races should be easy to call and being unambiguously wrong with the confidence interval should hurt more.
